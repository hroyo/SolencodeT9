1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the 256 bit word length in the EVM
Keccak256 is used to hash nodes in all 4 tries and ECDSA elliptic curve algorithm is used to generate addresses and sign txs.
Therefore, it is easier for the EVM to be made of 256 bit words.

2. What would happen if the implementation of a precompiled contract varied between Ethereum clients?
These happen offchain, so they would lead to different execution across clients and therefore lack of consensus about state
